#### User

Users identified as not being a technical lead of a project, such as an institutional or external user can view the last 12 months of their compute usage on SCW. 

Upon a successful login to MySCW, the default view of the homepage will render charts of various compute metrics.

By default, the charts will display the cumulative totals of the users usage for the projects in which the user has a valid project membership. The user can filter the results on a per project basis by selecting the ‘Project Filter’ dropdown option and selecting a project.
