#### User

Users identified as not being a technical lead of a project, such as an institutional or external user can view the last 12 months of their compute usage on SCW. 

Upon a successful login to MySCW, the default view of the homepage will render charts of various compute metrics.

By default, the charts will display the cumulative totals of a users usage for the projects in which a user has a valid project membership. A user can filter the results on a per project basis by selecting the ‘Project Filter’ dropdown option and selecting a project.
